# What is this?
This is the testing application in the console before I added a gui to the whole thing. It works like the other one should, if not easier or better!
## Testing
There are two files, words.txt for simplified and making sure your functions work, then letterSearch.txt for testing it on all of the words
## Bruh
Excuse the HUMONGOUS word file, it had to be that way...
